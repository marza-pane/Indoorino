# INDOORINO

## NOTE: this project is still under development. 

Smart home with Arduino and ESP8266. Indoorino is a C/C++ library, it has its own packet system used by Arduino/ESP to send messages to desktop applications. User Interface is (will be) written in Python with a compiled module built on Indoorino library.

I have no idea why I'm writing all of this, I am not a developer, I am an industrial engineer.

about me:
stackoverflow: your question is just like you, stupid and pointless
linuxquestions: please read the man, it's written in there
google: please stop asking me how to write "available" or "received"
